qtruby (4:4.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release, split from the kdebindings source.

  [ David Palacio ]
  * Follow package naming guidelines for Ruby.
  * Split Qt modules in own packages.
  * Package QScintilla2 binding.
  * Update control:
    - add ruby-qt4-dbg
    - update Uploaders
    - remove redundant section fields
    - add inter-module dependencies
  * Switch to dh7:
    - clean rules
    - pass --list-missing to dh_install
  * Adapt watch file to the new source name.
  * Adapt Vcs fields.
  * Switch copyright to the DEP-5 format, revision 174.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update rules:
    - pass sodeps as dh addon
    - do not compress .rb, .ui, .mng, and .xbel files (found in the examples)
    - manually export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags now,
      as dpkg-buildpackage does not do that anymore
    - generate libraries shlibs based on the current version
    - tighten the various libraries dependencies to the current version
  * Update control:
    - ruby-qt4-dbg: make it break/replace kdebindings-dbg, and recommend
      libruby1.8-dbg
    - add ${misc:Depends} to the packages lacking it
    - improve descriptions
    - require smoke-dev-tools >= 4.7.1, and make libqtruby4shared-dev
      depend on it
    - require libsmokeqt4-dev >= 4.7.1
    - tighten the dependencies of the ruby-* modules wrt ruby-qt4
  * Update the patches:
    - strip sequence numbers from the filenames
    - refresh
    - add DEP-3 headers for patches which didn't have them
  * Install the examples for qscintilla and qttest.
  * Compress all the examples installed by ruby-qt4 in a single examples.tar.gz
    archive, reducing the space they take.
  * Update copyright, adding myself to it.

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Remove myself from Uploaders.
